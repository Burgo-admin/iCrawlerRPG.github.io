# ICrawler
Current version: alpha v0.8

This was an idea that was on my head for a few days now. I've finally had the patience to sit down and actually code.
It is currently in a very early stage, but it's playable enough for me to be satisfied with posting it here.

I'm currently looking for ideas for spells and upgrades. You can open an issue for that. If possible, tell me how far you have progressed into the tower.

## Changelog
**Changes in alpha v0.8:**

*New active turn-combat system!*

- Attack by clicking the "Fight" button.
- Or you can cast a spell from your spellbook.
- If things get too rough, there's no shame in running away with the "Run" button!

*New active exploration system*
- Click the "Explore" button to explore some of the floor.
- If a battle start, you cannot neither explore nor rest until it ends.
- You can't cast spells when resting anymore, either.

*Idle Mode!*
- For those who are not fans of clicking, Idle Mode makes the game work just as before!
- Whenever you're not in battle, floor will be explored automatically.
- In battle, melee attacks only will be used (unless upgraded)!
- You can still manually cast spells, or melee/run during battle.
- When the battle ends, auto rest kicks in, so you don't even need to worry about dying!
- Time speed may only be changed with Idle Mode ON

*Dynamic Monsters!*
- Monsters are now generated dynamically, with various stat distributions.
- That make every monster encounter different, even if they're the same type!
- At each floor, monsters get stronger.
- Don't think you'll beat a floor 5 Rat easily just because you beat a floor 1 one.
