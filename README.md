# ICrawler
Current version: alpha v0.8.1

This was an idea that was on my head for a few days now. I've finally had the patience to sit down and actually code.
It is currently in a very early stage, but it's playable enough for me to be satisfied with posting it here.

I'm currently looking for ideas for spells and upgrades. You can open an issue for that. If possible, tell me how far you have progressed into the tower.
