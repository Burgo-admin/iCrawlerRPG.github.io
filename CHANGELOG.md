*New Idle settings!*
- Adjust the slider to choose at which HP percentage you want to auto-rest while Idle is ON.
- Minimum is 10%, all the way up to 100%.

*Prettier UI! (thanks to @peterbrinck !)*
- Who doesn't love pretty things?

**Changes in alpha v0.8:**

*New active turn-combat system!*
- Attack by clicking the "Fight" button.
- Or you can cast a spell from your spellbook.
- If things get too rough, there's no shame in running away with the "Run" button!

*New active exploration system*
- Click the "Explore" button to explore some of the floor.
- If a battle start, you cannot neither explore nor rest until it ends.
- You can't cast spells when resting anymore, either.

*Idle Mode!*
- For those who are not fans of clicking, Idle Mode makes the game work just as before!
- Whenever you're not in battle, floor will be explored automatically.
- In battle, melee attacks only will be used (unless upgraded)!
- You can still manually cast spells, or melee/run during battle.
- When the battle ends, auto rest kicks in, so you don't even need to worry about dying!
- Time speed may only be changed with Idle Mode ON

*Dynamic Monsters!*
- Monsters are now generated dynamically, with various stat distributions.
- That make every monster encounter different, even if they're the same type!
- At each floor, monsters get stronger.
- Don't think you'll beat a floor 5 Rat easily just because you beat a floor 1 one.
